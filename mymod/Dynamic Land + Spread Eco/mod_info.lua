description = "Makes land operations way more dynamic, which makes land( sometimes an useless hord of T1,T2,T3 units) worth consideration. It is not necessarily easier to play them, but for sure provided skillful players, these units can deal huge damage.At the same time less mass is produced from higher level extractors which in turn encourages expansion."
